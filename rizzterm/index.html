Unless you accept this Agreement, otherwise you have no right or authorization to use any part of the Services which requires you to be a Registered User. By checking the “I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and User Agreement” checkbox and completing the registration (sign-up) process, or continue to use or access any of the Services as a Registered User, you agree and represent to us:

Your fundamental rights as a Registered User to the Services are mainly set forth in this Agreement, so please read all of the terms and conditions carefully. This Agreement includes an agreement to resolve disputes by arbitration on an individual basis. The venue of such arbitration may not be in the country where you reside. Due to fast developing technologies and law and policies, as well as volatile market conditions, the RIZZ reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or revise This Agreement from time to time at any time, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions. Any such modified or revised version will be effective at the time we first post it onto our Services (or at any other time designated in the terms of such version, if any). We will give you notification or provide you the opportunity to review such version by other means. Your continued use of the Services thereafter will constitute your acceptance of, and consent to, such modifications or revisions. If you object to any such modification or revision, your sole recourse shall be ceasing to use all of the Services.
